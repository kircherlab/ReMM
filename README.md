# MA-ReMM

The Regulatory Mendelian Mutation (ReMM) score was created for relevance prediction of non-coding variations (SNVs and small InDels) in the human genome (GRCh37) in terms of Mendelian diseases. This project updates the ReMM score for the genome build GRCh38. 

The workflow is managed by Snakemake - a workflow management system used to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.
